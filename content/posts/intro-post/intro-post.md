## Introduction

Hello, I'm Michael Buhidar, welcome to my profile site.

By profession, I'm a product development engineer developing construction machines and their supporting technologies, but I'm also working to learn software development. Currently focused on learning Python along with its surrounding ecosystem.

I am an open-source enthusiast. I have learned so much from the open-source community and I am excited about how it brings developers together from all around the world. I also enjoy helping people learn new things and solve problems.

## Projects

My recent projects relate to modernizing the experience of typing in Commodore 64 games from magazines popular in the 80's (throwback to my coding interests when I was in middle/high school).  I use those projects to learn by creating something "real" to hone not only Python skills, but also Assembly, Pytest, pre-commit, Git, Github, PyPi release process, and so many other things.

### Wood Stove Damper Regulator
One of my projects is a [**wood stove damper regulator**](https://github.com/mbuhidar/WoodStoveRegulator), a microcontroler-powered stove damper regulation system that automatically controls the air damper position on a wood stove to maintain a constant stove temperature.

### Retrotype Type-in Tools
I also love tinkering with retro computing equipment and software and have collaborated on several projects that involve typing-in, debugging, and converting 1980s magazine type-in games and programs for use with Commodore emulators and original hardware. I'm currently working on a library of type-in tools named [**retrotype**](https://github.com/mbuhidar/retrotype) that converts text listings to Commodore 64 native format and emulates the bug checkers that were used to debug type-in programs back in the day.

### Retro Type-in Games
There is also a type-in game repository named [**retro_typein_games**](https://github.com/mbuhidar/retro_typein_games) that is a collaborative repository of type-in games from 1980s magazines that have been converted to Commodore 64 native format and are ready to run on an emulator or original hardware. Obviously, there is not much value in typing in these games today, but it is a great way to learn about the Commodore 64 while using modern editors and development environments. 

## Open-source Contributions

Another great use is to learn how to contribute to open-source projects by submitting pull requests to add games to the repository. I welcome code and issue submissions and am happy to work together to help get your.
