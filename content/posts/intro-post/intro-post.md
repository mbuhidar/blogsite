## Introduction

### Hello, I'm [Michael Buhidar](mbuhidar.com). Welcome to my profile site.

By profession, I'm a product development engineer developing construction machines and their supporting technologies, but I'm also working to learn software development. Currently focused on learning Python along with the surrounding ecosystem.

I am an open-source enthusiast. I have learned so much from the open-source community and I am excited about how it brings developers together from all around the world. I also enjoy helping people learn new things and solve problems.

My recent projects relate to modernizing the experience of typing in Commodore 64 games from magazines popular in the 80's (throwback to my coding interests when I was in middle/high school).  I use those projects to learn by creating something "real" to hone not only Python skills, but also Assembly, Pytest, pre-commit, Git, Github, PyPi release process, and so many other things.

One of my projects is a [**Wood Stove Regulator**](https://github.com/mbuhidar/WoodStoveRegulator), a microcontroler-powered stove damper regulation system that automatically controls the air damper position on a wood stove to maintain a constant stove temperature.

I'm also love tinkering with retro computing and have collaborated on several projects that involve typing-in, debugging, and converting 1980s magazine type-in games and programs for use with Commodore emulators and original hardware. I'm currently working on a library of type-in tools named [**retrotype**](https://github.com/mbuhidar/retrotype).
