### General Interests

By profession, I'm a product development engineer working to create construction vehicles and their supporting technologies, but I'm also working to learn software development using modern tools and languages. Currently focused on learning Python along with the surrounding ecosystem

I am an open-source enthusiast. I have learned so much from the open-source community and I am excited about how it brings developers together from all around the world. I also enjoy helping people learn new things and solve problems.

My primary projects relate to modernizing the experience of typing in Commodore 64 games from magazines popular in the 80's (throwback to my coding interests when I was in middle/high school). Using those projects mostly to learn by creating something "real" to hone not only Python skills, but also learning/knowledge for C64 BASIC, Assembly, pytest, Git, Github, releasing projects on PyPi, and so many other things.

### My development environment 

I use [ubuntu linux](https://ubuntu.com) and VSCode with a Vim keybindings extension as my development environment. You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/mbuhidar/dotfiles).

I enjoy working with open source software projects, most of them are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mbuhidar).

### Projects I'm currently working on:

[Wood Stove Regulator](https://github.com/mbuhidar/WoodStoveRegulator):

A project to create a wood stove regulator to control the air intake to the stove based on the temperature of the stove pipe using a micro-controller.

[retrotype](https://github.com/mbuhidar/retrotype):

A Python package to help modernize the experience of typing in Commodore 64 games from magazines popular in the 80's.

[retro-typein-games](https://github.com/mbuhidar/retro_typein_games):

A collaborative repository for typing-in, debugging, and converting 1980s magazine type-in games and programs for use with Commodore emulators and original hardware.
